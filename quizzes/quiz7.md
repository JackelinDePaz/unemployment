# Quiz 7: Tightness Fluctuations
 
### Question A

Consider a one-period matching model with a labor force of size 1. All workers are initially unemployed; firms post vacancies and match with workers; then production occurs. The matching function is $m = \sqrt{V}$. Firms incur a recruiting cost of $r > 0$ recruiters per vacancy. Firms have a production function $y = 2 \times a \times \sqrt{N}$, where $a$ governs labor productivity and $N$ denotes the number of producers in the firm. Firms pay a rigid wage: $w = a^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma <1$. What is the elasticity of vacancies $V$ with respect to productivity $a$ in the model?

1. $\epsilon^{V}_a = (1-\gamma) \cdot  (1+\tau)$
2. $\epsilon^{V}_a = 4 \cdot \frac{1-\gamma}{1+\tau}$
3. $\epsilon^{V}_a = 2\cdot \frac{1+\tau}{1-\gamma}$
4. $\epsilon^{V}_a = 4 \cdot (1-\gamma) -\tau$
5. $\epsilon^{V}_a = 2 \cdot \gamma - r$
6. $\epsilon^{V}_a = 0$
7. None of the above

### Question B

Under a standard US calibration, what is the value of the elasticity computed in Question H?

1. $\epsilon^{V}_a < 0$
2. $\epsilon^{V}_a \in [0,1]$
3. $\epsilon^{V}_a \in (1,2]$
4. $\epsilon^{V}_a \in (2,3]$
5. $\epsilon^{V}_a \in (3,4]$
6. $\epsilon^{V}_a \in (4,5]$
7. $\epsilon^{V}_a > 5$
