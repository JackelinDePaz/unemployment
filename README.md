# Unemployment: Models and Policies

This repository contains material for a half-semester graduate course on unemployment.

## Overview

The course covers research topics related to unemployment. It reviews basic facts about unemployment, presents models used to describe unemployment, and discusses policies used to tackle unemployment. It addresses the following questions: 

* Why do we care about unemployment?
* Why does unemployment exist? 
* Why does unemployment vary across countries and over time? 
* What is the socially optimal level of unemployment? 
* How should policies respond to unemployment spikes during recessions?

The course is hosted at https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t1.html.

## Organization

This is a flipped course. Students watch lecture videos at home, and class time is used to discuss the lecture material and put it to practice through quizzes. All the lecture videos are permanently available at https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t1.html. Each quiz is composed of several multiple-choice questions. In class, students tackle the multiple-choice questions, and the multiple-choice questions are then solved. Students must also go over readings and complete 3 problem sets at home. Finally, the course concludes with a 3-hour in-class exam.

## Material

The repository contains all the material for the course:

* `syllabus.md` - syllabus for the course
* `notes` folder - 7 sets of lectures notes, narrated in the [lecture videos](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t1.html)
* `quizzes` folder - 9 one-hour quizzes and their solutions
* `homework` folder - 3 problem sets and their solutions
* `exam` folder - a three-hour exam and its solutions
* `figures` folder - figures used in the solutions to the quizzes and problem sets
* `references` folder - no textbook is required for this course, but the articles and book chapters in the folder provide useful background material for the lectures (the articles and books are discussed at various points in the lectures)

## Software

The teaching material is written in Markdown. The Markdown files were produced on a Mac (macOS Monterey 12.2.1) with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) (build 4126) using the following package: [Markdown Editing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing), [Markdown Preview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownPreview), [LiveReload](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LiveReload).

This [Sublime Test setup](https://rowannicholls.github.io/sublime_text/markdown.html) nicely renders math and figures and tables in Markdown.
