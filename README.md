# Unemployment: Models and Policies

This repository contains material for a half-semester graduate course on unemployment.

## Overview

The course covers research topics related to unemployment. It reviews basic facts about unemployment, presents models used to describe unemployment, and discusses policies used to tackle unemployment. It addresses the following questions: 

* Why do we care about unemployment?
* What causes unemployment? 
* Why does unemployment vary across countries and over time? 
* What is the socially optimal level of unemployment? 
* How should policies respond to unemployment spikes during recessions?

The course is hosted at https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t1.html.

## Organization

This is a flipped course. Students watch lecture videos at home, and class time is used to discuss lecture material and put it to practice through quizzes. The lecture videos are permanently available at https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t1.html. Each quiz is composed of several multiple-choice questions, which students tackle in class. At home, students must also go over readings and complete 3 problem sets. The course concludes with a 3-hour in-class exam.

## Material

The repository contains all the material for the course:

* `syllabus.md` - syllabus for the course
* `notes` folder - 7 sets of lectures notes, narrated in the [lecture videos](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t1.html)
