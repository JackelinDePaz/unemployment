This part of the course covers research topics related to unemployment. We will review basic facts about unemployment, present models used to describe unemployment, and discuss policies used to tackle unemployment. We will try to answer several questions: 

+ Why do we care about unemployment?
+ Why does unemployment exist? 
+ Why does unemployment vary across countries and over time? 
+ What is the socially optimal level of unemployment? 
+ How should unemployment insurance and fiscal policy respond to unemployment spikes during recessions?

### Office hours

Office hours will be conducted on Zoom. You can join the office hours at any time. If no other student is present, you will be able to talk immediately and one-on-one. If another student is already present, Zoom will place you in a waiting room, and you will have to wait a little bit until the previous student is gone. 

### Grading

Your grade for this part of the course will be out of 50 points, based on the following factors:
+ Problem set 1: 10 points
+ Problem set 2: 10 points
+ Problem set 3: 10 points
+ Exam: 20 points
+ Total: 50 points

The other part of the course will also be graded out of 50 points. The grade for the entire course will be the sum of the grades in the two parts; it will be out of 100 points. Letter grades will be based on your total grade, with the following cutoffs:
+ Above 80/100:  A
+ Between 60/100 and 80/100: B
+ Between 40/100 and 60/100: C
+ Below 40/100: NC

### Communication

We will be using the course website on Canvas for all course-related announcements, communication, and discussions: https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1087669. Through the `Announcements`, `Discussions`, and `Chat` tabs, Canvas is designed to get you help quickly and efficiently—which emails are notoriously bad at. So rather than emailing questions to the teaching team or each other, I encourage you to:

+ Post your quick questions in the `Chat` tab
+ Post your substantial questions in the `Discussions` tab
+ Respond to the queries of your fellow students whenever you can

The quicker you begin asking questions on Canvas, the quicker you will benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. I encourage you to ask questions whenever you have a logistical question, you are struggling to understand a concept, or something is not clear. 

In these very strange times, we have all been more isolated. But it is my hope that through Canvas we can create a tight-knit, active, helpful community.
