#### Presentation of readings

Most Thursday class meetings will be devoted to discussing readings. To lead the discussion, students will give 10-minute presentations that summarize the readings for the week. Each student will give two reading presentations during the quarter. The presentations will be scheduled one week in advance.

Each presentation should have 6 slides addressing the following questions:

1. CONTEXT: How does the paper relate to the lecture material? How does it contribute to the course material?
2. QUESTION: What is the research question addressed by the paper?
3. ANSWER: What are the main elements of the answer to the research question?
4. POSITIONING: How does the material in the paper contribute to the previous  literature?
5. ILLUSTRATION: Illustrate graphically the answer to the research question or an interesting mechanism discussed in the paper.
6. CONCLUSION: What are the limitations of the answer provided in the paper? How could the answer be improved?

Presentation slides must be written in LaTeX and compiled to a PDF.

#### Research paper

This is a research-intensive course which will serve as good preparation for students interested in pursuing further studies in macroeconomics, especially a PhD. 

In this course you will shift away from learning the results of other peoples' research into learning how to conduct your own research. You will therefore devote a good part of the course to active research. You will learn:

+ How to select a research question
+ How to develop and refine the answer to your research question
+ How to position your paper in the literature

By the end of the course, you will have experienced all the stages of a research project and completed a short research paper on a topic related to unemployment.

#### Objective of the paper

A good research paper should do the following:

+ Develop a well-posed research question
+ Answer the research question using a combination of theory, simulations, and empirical analysis
+ Position the paper in the prior literature

The project will be evaluated based on quality of analysis, clarity, and originality.

More specifically, the final paper should follow standard guidelines for research papers:

1. It should describe in details the research question you are answering, and explain why it is a relevant and important question.
2. It should provide a thorough review of the prior literature, and it should explain how the paper contributes to and advances that literature.
3. It should describe the model, tools, and data used to answer the questions. 
4. It should describe in details the main result obtained in the analysis. 

    * For a theoretical analysis: use lemmas, propositions, proofs, and diagrams
    * For a numerical or empirical analysis: use tables and figures

5. It should discuss the limitations of the current analysis, and how these will be addressed in the future.


#### Research teams

It might be difficult to complete a research paper in one quarter by oneself, which is why you will have the option to work on the research paper in a team of up to 4 students. Each team will choose a research topic, collaborate on the research project, give joint presentations, and jointly write the research paper. All members of the team will receive the same marks for the presentations and paper. The standards for the presentations and paper will be the same irrespective of the number of students in a team.

Most Tuesday class meetings will be devoted to team research. 

#### Due dates

+ **Tuesday 23 April/Thursday 25 April**: class presentation of project outline
+ **Tuesday 14 May/Thursday 16 May**: class presentation of early results
+ **Tuesday 4 June/Thursday 6 June**: class presentation of final results
+ **Thursday 13 June at noon**: final paper due [by email](mailto:mbessari@ucsc.edu)

#### Format of the presentations

The project outline should be presented in 10 minutes with 5 slides.

+ Slide 1: research question—what are you asking in the project & why that matters
+ Slide 2: positioning—what we already know & what we do not yet know
+ Slide 3: research methodology—how you will address the research question
+ Slides 4: overview of what you have so far—data & model & code
+ Slide 5: hurdles & next steps
+ It is fine to propose several possible projects.

Early and final results should be presented in 15 minutes with 7–8 slides.

+ Slide 1: review the research question & positioning of the project
+ Slides 2–4: overview of the data, model, & method
+ Slides 5–7: overview of the results
+ Slide 8: summary & next steps

Presentation slides must be written in LaTeX and compiled to a PDF.

### Format of the paper

Your research paper should be short and follow the *AER: Insights* guidelines:

+ Manuscripts must be less than 6,000 words. The wordcount applies to the main body of the text, but excludes title page, reference list, and exhibits.
+ Manuscripts should contain no more than 5 exhibits (tables and figures). Individual exhibits are limited to one page each.
+ Manuscripts must include an abstract of 100 or fewer words.
+ Papers must be self-contained. Specifically, a reader should be able follow the analysis in the paper and be convinced it is correct and coherent from the main text alone, without consulting the appendix. For empirical work, the main text should include relevant information about data sources, variable definitions and construction, the estimating equations, and any other information needed to understand and assess each exhibit in the main text. For theoretical work, proofs should typically be contained in the paper. This is the case when the proof itself provides insight into the paper's argument or when the method of proof is innovative.

The research paper must be written in LaTeX, compiled to a PDF, and [submitted to Mariana by email](mailto:mbessari@ucsc.edu) before the due date.

#### Math resources

The course relies on basic mathematical methods such as unconstrained and constrained optimization, and linear and nonlinear differential equations—including phase diagrams.

So you are expected to have good command of this material. Appropriate courses in the department of Applied Mathematics will provide a great preparation for the course. In additional, a good reference for the material used in the course is [Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Mathematics-Economic-Analysis-Sydsaeter-dp-1292359285/dp/1292359285/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), by K. Sydsaeter, P. Hammond, A. Strom, and A. Carvajal.

See also [these lecture notes](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c3/) for a review of the material—although not everything covered in these notes is required for the course.

#### Writing resources

There is no textbook for this course, but several books might be helpful to write your research paper.

First and foremost, a good research paper needs to have a good structure. A good reference on how to structure your paper is [The Little Book of Research Writing](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Research-Writing/dp/1974673162) by V. Chaubey.

Scientific papers involve an elements that does not appear in other writings but is fundamental to communicate scientific ideas: graphs. It is important to make clear, clean, and meaningful graphs. A great reference on how to create compelling graphs is [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) by E.R. Tufte.

Once your paper has a good structure and good graphs, it does not hurt to have a decent style—to help readers go through the paper. The canonical reference on style is [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-4th-William-Strunk/dp/0205313426) by W. Strunk and E. B. White.

Whatever you write, it is important to follow the rules and conventions of the English language. The canonical manual—followed by most US journals—is the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). You should consult it if you have any question about English writing, rules, conventions, and style.

#### LaTeX resources

LaTeX is the best system to typeset scientific research. In particular, it allows to typeset mathematical expressions, insert tables and figures with results, and manage scientific references. This is why you are asked to write your presentation slides and research paper in LaTeX. If you continue on a research path, you will need to use LaTeX, so it is good to learn how to use it now.

LaTeX templates are available on GitHub to help you write your presentations and research paper:

+ [LaTeX template for research paper](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper)
+ [LaTeX template for research presentations](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-presentation)

These templates follow typographical best practices and have a minimalist design. You can also [use these LaTeX commands](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math) in conjunction with the templates to obtain mathematical expressions that are more legible.

If you are new to LaTeX, feel free [to use Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/ucsantacruz), for which UCSC supplies professional accounts. Overleaf makes it easy to produce research paper and research presentations in LaTeX directly from your web browser. You can use the templates with Overleaf.
